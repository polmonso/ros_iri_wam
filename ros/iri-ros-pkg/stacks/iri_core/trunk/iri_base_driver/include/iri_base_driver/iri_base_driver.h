/**
 * \brief IRI ROS Base Driver Class
 *
 * This class inherits from the ROS class driver_base::Driver, which provides 
 * the guidelines for any driver kind. The IriBaseDriver class offers an easy 
 * framework to integrate functional drivers implemented in C++ with the ROS 
 * driver structure. A shared library is generated together with IriBaseNodeDriver 
 * class to force implementation of virtual methods to final user. Common use 
 * functions to open, close, start  and stop a driver need to be filled up when 
 * instantiating this class. ROS  provides state transition methods to change 
 * from one state to another.
 *
 * This class is used as an intermediate level between ROS basic classes and the
 * user final driver implementation. Methods to manage drivers are implemented 
 * to provide common features to all driver-type objects. New methods are 
 * provided to the user for the specific driver needs.
 *
 * Instances of both IriBaseDriver and IriBaseNodeDriver can be easly generated 
 * with the  iri_ros_scripts package. Similarly, data can be sent and read 
 * through ROS topics by using those scripts. The scripts can be downloaded 
 * from the iri_stack SVN.
