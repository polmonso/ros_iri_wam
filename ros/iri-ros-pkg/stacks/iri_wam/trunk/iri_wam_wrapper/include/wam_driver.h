/**
 * \brief IRI ROS Specific Driver Class
 *
 * This class inherits from the IRI Base class IriBaseDriver, which provides the
 * guidelines to implement any specific driver. The IriBaseDriver class offers an
 * easy framework to integrate functional drivers implemented in C++ with the
 * ROS driver structure. ROS driver_base state transitions are already managed
 * by IriBaseDriver.
 *
 * The WamDriver class must implement all specific driver requirements to
 * safetely open, close, run and stop the driver at any time. It also must
 * guarantee an accessible interface for all driver's parameters.
 *
 * The WamConfig.cfg needs to be filled up with those parameters suitable
 * to be changed dynamically by the ROS dyanmic reconfigure application. The
 * implementation of the CIriNode class will manage those parameters through
 * methods like postNodeOpenHook() and reconfigureNodeHook().
 *
