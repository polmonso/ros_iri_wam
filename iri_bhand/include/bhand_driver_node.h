/**
 * \brief IRI ROS Specific Driver Class
 *
 * This class inherits from the IRI Core class IriBaseNodeDriver<IriBaseDriver>, 
 * to provide an execution thread to the driver object. A complete framework  
 * with utilites to test the node functionallity or to add diagnostics to  
 * specific situations is also given. The inherit template design form allows  
 * complete access to any IriBaseDriver object implementation.
 *
 * As mentioned, tests in the different driver states can be performed through 
 * class methods such as addNodeOpenedTests() or addNodeRunningTests(). Tests
 * common to all nodes may be also executed in the pattern class IriBaseNodeDriver.
 * Similarly to the tests, diagnostics can easyly be added. See ROS Wiki for
 * more details:
 * http://www.ros.org/wiki/diagnostics/ (Tutorials: Creating a Diagnostic Analyzer)
 * http://www.ros.org/wiki/self_test/ (Example: Self Test)
